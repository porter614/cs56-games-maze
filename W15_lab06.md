This project is very well thought out and complete. The build.xml files contains targets that are clear and concise, and the source files are named well and defined well within the javadoc. However, some of the code could definitely be refactored to make it more clear how each function works. There also seems to be and issue with GUI capabilties on a MAC OS. This may be a local isssue, as I may be missing some external library, but nonetheless i cannot navigate through parts of the GUI on my local computer.

Bugs:

Creating a new maze after a maze has been loaded into the menu cause the timer in the lower options bar to reset to the elapsed time of the saved maze. It should reset to 0. 

When you load in a High Score Maze, the black square for the old character remains in the finish cell, when it should not actually appear at all. 

When you click Save in the Menu bar, followed by clicking "Cancel", the maze timer remains stopped while it should continue running.




What we added this week:
We implemented a Pause Feature that allows you to pause the game by pressing 'P'.

We added a high score table that saves all scores to a serialized file and presents them in a table.
